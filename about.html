        <h2 class="text-secondary">BIO:</h2>
        <p>I am a Computer Engineering student from the University of Alberta. Ever since I was young I have been fascinated
          with the way technology works and how it can be used to make our world a better place. From building robotic arms to designing and building 
          web applications, I have experienced a huge variety of different types of software development. 
        </p>
        <p>I am mainly focused on developing web applications currently, but plan to move into mobile development in the near future. </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school I am super into photography, music and art. I love rock climbing and mountian biking in the summer and skiing in the winter.
           Check out my <a href="blog.html">blog</a> for some more interests of mine!

      <h2 class="interests text-secondary">What I Am Experianced With:</h2>
      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <h5>JavaScript (Most Experianced), Python (Intermediate), C & C++ (Intermediate), Java (Beginner), Matlab(Forgotten) and C# (Beginner)</h5>
        <p>Jokes on my french teacher who said I would never be able to learn another language, I now know 6! Currently JavaScript is my primary 
          language of choice for the sole fact that it can be used for so many amazing things, is super fast, and is essential for Web Development.
          When I work with the ROSS operating system for robotics, its all C++ from here. C++ is amazing for when you need that extra boost of speed 
          or are working super low level. As my first programming language (We arn't counting Matlab) it will always have a special place in my heart.
        </p>

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>Frameworks & Technologies</h3>
        <h5>React & React Native, D3, .NET & ASP.NET, HTML/CSS/SASS, JSON, JavaFX, NodeJS & Express, Flask, Arduino, ROSS </h5>
        <p>I am forever grateful I am growing up in a era of amazing frameworks built so that even the most inexperienced of Engineers can build something
          awesome! If you grew up before this era or even wrote some of these frameworks, you have my utmost respect. 
          My primary interest right now is web development, so learning the React framework has really helped me to improve both my ES6/7 knowledge
          and my object oriented design skills. I also love using Arduino to create and build stupidly fun hardware projects like robotic arms and drones.
          When it comes to mobile development I've just started learning React Native to get cross platform apps from one codebase. Android Studio and X-Code 
          are next on the list!
        </p>

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>Software and Operating Systems</h3>
        <h5>Windows and Linux</h5>
        <p>By working on .NET projects based in Windows and Web/Java development on Linux (Ubuntu Specifically), I have gained in depth knowledge
          of how these systems operate and what development looks like on both sides of the coin. Visual Studio, Intellij, Android Studio, VS Code
          and Sublime are all IDES I've worked with professionally and on my own.
