              Hi there! 
            </p>
            <p>
              Hope you are doing well. My name is Evan and you are currently reading my blog (I know crazy right?) . I’ve always wanted a medium for expressing some of my thoughts that wasn’t a form of social media, so I’ve decided to add a section to my personal website. I plan on discussing and detailing my journey as a student, hopefully I don’t come across as overly boring.
            </p>
            <p>
              A little bit about myself: I am a entering my  third year of computer engineering at the University of Alberta. It’s a degree designed for giving the student a strong background on how to design computer components, from graphics cards to processors. It’s a exciting degree because I am able to both learn electrical engineering concepts like discrete and continuous signals. I also however, take quite a few classes on computer software design. This means I have a programming background as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              While most of my time is currently taken up with school, I do try my best to maintain as much of a  life as I can outside of it. For me, this revolves around staying active (I ski, mountain bike, box, weight lift and hike) but also engaging in a lot of personal projects that interest me. My philosophy is that a engineering degree (or any degree for that matter) is not a representation of who you are. It only represents that you have gained knowledge in a specific area, and in order for you to be successful after you graduate, you need to be putting the time into pursuits that both interest, challenge and continue to grow you. After all, isn’t learning a lifelong process?
            </p>
            <p>
              So that about wraps it up for a first post. Hopefully it wasn’t a complete disaster and you aren't frantically trying to close this window as you read this. My goal is to write a post a week, so obviously you should keep this page book marked because, well who wouldn’t want to read an couple paragraphs about my exciting life (totally kidding).
            </p>
            <p>
              Cheers,
            </p>
            <p>
