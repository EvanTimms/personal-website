                    I have always thought that to be great at anything, you must be willing to constantly learn and improve at the subject. 
                    When it comes to programming and computer science I am fanscinated by the plethera of languages and technologies at my 
                    fingertips, but am disapionted that the languages and frameworks used in class are often outdated and not a good picture 
                    of what the industry as a whole is using to engineer and develop software. My passion for learning about programming has lead 
                    me to take courses in my spare time in addition to what I learn in school. Udemy is a personal favourite of mine, and I am
                    enrolled in a total of six courses on their website.
                </p>

                    All of my web and mobile developement knowledge has been gained through taking two Web Developer Bootcamps on the site (A total
                    of about 80 hours). I've also learned the Java language through Udemy as well as React. Lately, I have also been dipping my feet 
                    in machine learning, so that will be my next endevor to learn on my spare time.
